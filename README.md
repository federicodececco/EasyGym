This is a yet unnamed project, I envisioned it to be a PWA that can be used
to track users gym schedule, with a backoffice component for a coach to monitor their
trainees progresses and sessions.

Features
-Homepage with the schedule itself, to track exercies
-Page containing user infos and their gains and losses of mass.

Planned features
-Backoffice page
-Timer function to help trainees
-PWA implementation
-server communication, to track real data
-login page and system
-cacheing system

Technological stack
-NextJs, to realize the fronted part
-Tailwind, to realize the style part
-Primsa ORM and AWS, to form backend and db, yet to decide on this part though
