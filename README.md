EasyGym

I envisioned this App to be a PWA that can be used
to track users gym schedule, with a backoffice component for a coach to monitor their
trainees progresses and sessions.

navigate to "localhost:3000/docs" to read the docs about APIs created with Prisma

Features
-Homepage with the schedule itself, to track exercies.
-Page containing user infos and their gains and losses of mass.
-Backoffice page to allow a trainer to moniotr thier trainees.
-CRUD REST API to connect to db

Planned features

-Multi schedule
-Timer function to help trainees
-PWA implementation
-login page and system
-cacheing system

Technological stack
-NextJs, as a full-stack framewokr, handling front and back end
-Tailwind, to realize the style part
-Prisma ORM, with NextJs page routing to create REST APIs to link BE and DB
-PostgreSQL as DB, i plan to switch to another one when i get to the deployment phase
